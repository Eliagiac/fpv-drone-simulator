# Unity FPV Drone Simulator


**Note: This project is in the early stages of development. Contributions and feedback are welcome!**

## Overview

Welcome to my Unity FPV Drone Simulator! This project aims to provide a platform for building and experimenting with deep-learning neural networks to autonomously drive a first-person view (FPV) drone around intricate tracks.
Currently, the program has support for both keyboard and controller input for manual drone control in an empty environment.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unity-fpv-drone-simulator.git
```

2. Open the project in Unity Editor (compatible with Unity 2021.3 or later).

3. Start experimenting with manual drone control using keyboard or controller input.

## Usage

### Manual Control

- Use the left stick or WASD keys to control the drone's throttle and roll.
- Use the right stick or IJKL keys to control the drone's pitch and yaw.
- Press the right trigger or backspace to reset the drone's orientation.
- Double-tap the right trigger or backspace to reset the drone's position.

## Roadmap
- Customizable environments and tracks for training and testing purposes.
- Automated feedback on manual drone control to improve your skills with accuracy, speed, etc.
- Easy integration with deep-learning frameworks for developing autonomous driving algorithms.
